# Salary-prediction-using-Linear-Regression-and-Polynomial-Regression

This project aims to predict salaries based on years of experience using Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression. The dataset consists of years of experience as the independent variable and salary as the dependent variable. The project involves visualizing the data to understand the relationship, followed by training both linear and polynomial regression models. The performance of each model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score to determine which model provides a better fit. Linear Regression is tested for simple linear relationships, while Polynomial Regression is used to capture non-linear trends. The results help identify the most accurate model for salary prediction based on experience.
